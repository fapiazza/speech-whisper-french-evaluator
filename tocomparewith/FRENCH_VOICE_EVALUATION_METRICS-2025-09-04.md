# French Voice Fluency Evaluation Metrics for Alexa Production Readiness

## Executive Summary

This document defines the technical evaluation framework for assessing French voice naturalness and fluency in Alexa before production deployment. The metrics combine objective technical measurements with subjective human evaluation to ensure voice quality meets Amazon's standards for French-speaking customers.

## Evaluation Framework Overview

Our evaluation approach uses a multi-dimensional assessment covering:
- **Linguistic Accuracy**: Pronunciation, phonetics, and language rules
- **Prosodic Quality**: Rhythm, stress, intonation, and timing
- **Perceptual Naturalness**: Human-like quality and listener acceptance
- **Technical Performance**: System reliability and consistency

## Primary Success Metrics

### 1. Pronunciation Accuracy Score (PAS)
**Target: ≥ 95% accuracy**
- **Measurement**: Phoneme-level accuracy compared to native French reference recordings
- **Method**: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) confidence scores + expert linguistic review
- **Sample Size**: 1,000+ diverse French utterances covering regional variations
- **Tools**: Montreal Forced Alignment (MFA) or similar phonetic alignment tools

### 2. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Naturalness
**Target: ≥ 4.2/5.0**
- **Measurement**: Native French speaker subjective ratings on 5-point scale
- **Sample Size**: 50+ native French speakers from diverse regions (France, Quebec, Belgium, Switzerland)
- **Test Corpus**: 200 utterances covering various domains (weather, news, commands, conversational)
- **Scale**: 1=Very unnatural, 2=Unnatural, 3=Neutral, 4=Natural, 5=Very natural

### 3. Prosodic Quality Index (PQI)
**Target: ≥ 4.0/5.0**
- **Components**:
  - Rhythm naturalness (stress-timed vs syllable-timed patterns)
  - Intonation contour accuracy for French sentence types
  - Pause placement and duration appropriateness
  - Speaking rate consistency (target: 140-180 words per minute)
- **Measurement**: Combination of acoustic analysis and human evaluation

### 4. Fluency Disruption Rate (FDR)
**Target: ≤ 2% of utterances**
- **Measurement**: Percentage of utterances containing noticeable disfluencies
- **Disfluency Types**:
  - Unnatural pauses or hesitations
  - Incorrect liaison patterns
  - Mispronounced contractions or elisions
  - Robotic or choppy delivery

## Secondary Metrics

### 5. Regional Accent Consistency Score
**Target: ≥ 90% consistency within chosen variant**
- **Measurement**: Consistency in maintaining either European French or Canadian French pronunciation patterns
- **Method**: Acoustic feature analysis of vowel systems and consonant realizations

### 6. Emotion and Intent Recognition Accuracy
**Target: ≥ 85% accuracy**
- **Measurement**: Appropriate prosodic expression for different response types (informational, empathetic, urgent)
- **Test Cases**: 100+ scenarios requiring different emotional or pragmatic tones

### 7. Technical Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: Voice generation time ≤ 200ms for standard responses
- **Consistency**: Same text produces identical audio output 99.9% of the time
- **Memory Usage**: Within allocated system resources

## Evaluation Methodology

### Phase 1: Automated Technical Assessment
**Duration**: 2 weeks
- Run comprehensive phonetic analysis using automatic tools
- Measure acoustic features (F0, formants, duration, intensity)
- Compare against French reference corpus (Common Voice, LibriSpeech French)
- Generate automated reports for linguistic features

### Phase 2: Expert Linguistic Review
**Duration**: 1 week
- Native French linguists evaluate 500 randomly selected utterances
- Focus on:
  - Phonological accuracy
  - Morphophonological processes (liaison, enchainement)
  - Lexical stress patterns
  - Syntactic prosody alignment

### Phase 3: Human Perceptual Testing
**Duration**: 2 weeks
- Recruit 50+ native French speakers across target markets
- A/B testing against current production voice (if applicable)
- Blind evaluation preventing bias
- Statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)

### Phase 4: Edge Case Testing
**Duration**: 1 week
- Test challenging French linguistic phenomena:
  - Numbers and dates pronunciation
  - Proper nouns and foreign words
  - Regional expressions and colloquialisms
  - Code-switching scenarios (French-English)

## Test Corpus Specifications

### Linguistic Coverage
- **Phonetic Coverage**: All French phonemes in various contexts
- **Lexical Diversity**: 5,000+ unique words covering common Alexa domains
- **Syntactic Variety**: Questions, commands, statements, exclamations
- **Length Variation**: Single words to 20+ word utterances
- **Register Variation**: Formal and informal speech patterns

### Domain Coverage
- Weather and time information
- Music and entertainment requests
- Smart home commands
- News and information queries
- Conversational responses
- Error and clarification messages

## Production Readiness Criteria

### Go/No-Go Decision Matrix

**Must Meet (Blockers)**:
- PAS ≥ 95%
- MOS ≥ 4.0
- FDR ≤ 3%
- Zero critical mispronunciations (curse words, sensitive terms)

**Should Meet (Strong Recommendations)**:
- PQI ≥ 4.0
- Regional consistency ≥ 90%
- Emotion accuracy ≥ 80%

**Nice to Have**:
- MOS ≥ 4.5
- All technical performance targets met

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Liaison Errors**: French requires complex sandhi rules
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive rule-based post-processing + validation corpus
2. **Regional Variation Confusion**: Mixing European and Canadian features
   - *Mitigation*: Consistent training data from single variant
3. **Formal/Informal Register Mismatch**: Inappropriate level of formality
   - *Mitigation*: Context-aware response generation

### Fallback Procedures
- Maintain current production voice as backup
- Gradual rollout starting with low-risk utterances
- Real-time quality monitoring in production

## Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

### Production Monitoring
- Daily automated quality checks on sample utterances
- Weekly MOS sampling with reduced panel (10 evaluators)
- Monthly comprehensive review of customer feedback
- Quarterly full evaluation cycle

### Feedback Integration
- Customer complaint analysis for voice quality issues
- A/B testing for voice improvements
- Continuous model fine-tuning based on real usage patterns
